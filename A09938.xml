         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

confeſſe and acknowledge here in thy preſence, that all the imaginations of the thoughts of our hearts are
onely euill continually, yea euery man in his beſt eſtate is altogether vanitie. And we (duſt and aſhes) haue
grieuouſly ſinned, wee haue tranſgreſſed thine holy lawes and ordinances, we haue exceeded in meaſure,
number and weight, the iniquities of our forefathers, and haue thereby iuſtly deſerued that thou ſhouldeſt
in thy iuſt iudgement haue drawne forth the ſword of thy iuſtice, and executed vengeance, euen in the
higheſt degree againſt vs, according to the meaſure, number and weight of our manifold ſinnes and hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
iniquities, we are not worthy of the leaſt of all thy mercies. Wee humbly alſo confeſſe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
(euen againſt our ſelues) that neither thouſands of Rammes, nor tenne thouſand riuers of oyle (if we
were able and willing to yeeld them vnto thee) are ſufficient to ſatisfie thy iuſtice for the leaſt of the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which we haue committed againſt thee, if thou ſhouldeſt turne thine eye of mercy and compaſſion away from vs; and theſe things
heretofore we confeſſed (O Lord) but our liues we amended not. And yet notwithſtanding (O mercifull Lord, holy and louing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
ſo great is thy louing kindneſſe towards vs, and ſo manifold are thy mercies, that thou (of thy fauour) haſt beene pleaſed (euen in
pittie and compaſſion for thine owne ſake, without any deſert of ours) to pacifie thine owne wrath, by a few light and eaſie ſtrokes with
thy rod of correction, and ſo for a time to ceaſe thine anger, to trie vs if we would ſeeke after thee, not ſuffering thy puniſhing Angel to

And (finding vs a rebellious and ſtiff-necked people) haſt ſent out thine Angel to threaten and execute vengeance in greater weight,
and in greater meaſure againſt vs, if we will not amend. And yet in fauour ſtayeſt from executing thy fierce wrath. What ſhall we then
offer vnto thee (O Lord our God) for all the bleſſings which we haue reciued from thee? Thou haſt no neede to receiue of vs, all beaſts,
all cattell, all ſheepe on mountaines; yea the earth is thine, and all that therein is, the world, and they that dwel therein, we our ſelues, and
all that we haue are thine, what haue we that we haue not receiued of thee? We confeſſe (O Lord) euen againſt our ſelues, that we haue
nothing to offer but the calues of polluted lippes, proceeding from vncleane &amp; vncircumciſed hearts, that is, praiſe, thankes, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

which may kill, hurt and hinder, the ſeede or fruits of the earth, and giue vs holy Father (as gratiouſly in great mercie thou haſt giuen vs)

thy gracious fauour, as this yeare, ſo others alſo, at length reape the fruites of plentifull harueſts: And becauſe ſo it is (Lord) that thou
makeſt a land barren for the wickedneſſe of them that dwell therein, change thou our hearts (we humbly beſeech thee) roote out the
wickedneſſe from the hearts of the inhabitants of the land, and then we ſhall be ſure that the land ſhall yeeld her increaſe. Giue vs O
Lord thy grace and holy ſpirit, to guide and gouerne vs, and to hold vs within the liſts and limites of thy holy precepts and ordinances,
in ſuch ſort, as that we may for euer hereafter, vſe thy word as the onely wiſe, and al-ſufficient rule to ſquare our lines by, knowing that all
vnwritten verities, and all traditions, and inuentions of men, yea all the imaginations of the thoughts of our hearts are onely euill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually;
let thy word be a lanthorne to our feete, and a light vnto our pathes, knowing that therein is the true Kings high-way to be

looke into them) will be found to be but by-paths, leading to eternall death and deſtruction. Giue vs (O Lord) a holy and earneſt

him (Lord we beſeech thee) and ſtabliſh the throne of his Kingdome in his poſteritie in all ages, ſo as there may not want a man of his
